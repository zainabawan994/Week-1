# ðŸ’» HTML 7-Day Learning Report

This document provides a summary of my **7-day journey to learn HTML**, covering basic tags, layout structure, forms, media, semantic tags, and finally building a personal portfolio using only HTML.

## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Introduction to Web Development & HTML

On the first day, I was introduced to **web development** and **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language). I learned that HTML is the basic building block of web pages. I also studied the **structure of an HTML document**, which includes:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` â€“ defines the document type
- `<html>` â€“ the root element
- `<head>` â€“ contains meta information and title
- `<body>` â€“ contains the visible content

## ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Basic HTML Tags

On day 2, I explored the most common **basic tags** used in HTML:

- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<title>` â€“ basic structure
- Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>` â€“ used to define headings from largest to smallest
- Paragraph: `<p>` â€“ used for writing paragraphs
- Line Break: `<br>` â€“ for breaking lines
- Horizontal Rule: `<hr>` â€“ to draw horizontal lines

These tags helped me understand how to create well-structured text content on a webpage.

## ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ Lists and Tables

Day 3 was focused on **organizing content** using lists and tables.

### Lists:
- `<ul>` â€“ unordered list (with bullet points)
- `<ol>` â€“ ordered list (with numbers)
- `<li>` â€“ list item

### Tables:
- `<table>` â€“ creates a table
- `<tr>` â€“ defines a row
- `<td>` â€“ defines a data cell
- `<th>` â€“ defines a header cell

I learned how to display data in both **list format** and **tabular format** using these tags.

## ðŸ“… Day 4 â€“ Forms, Media & Semantic Tags

Day 4 combined three important parts of HTML:

### âœ… Forms
I learned to collect user input using the following tags:
- `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<label>`, `<button>`
I also used attributes like `type`, `placeholder`, and `required` for basic **form validation**.

### âœ… Media
I added different media to a web page:
- `<img>` â€“ for images
- `<audio>` â€“ for adding audio files
- `<video>` â€“ for playing videos
- `<iframe>` â€“ for embedding other web pages

### âœ… Semantic Tags
To structure the page properly, I used:
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`

## ðŸ“… Day 5 â€“ Project: Personal Portfolio Website

On the last day, I created a **basic personal portfolio website** using only HTML.  
The portfolio includes:

- My name, photo, and a short introduction
- My **education** details (BS Software Engineering â€“ University of Haripur)
- A **skills section** listing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Graphic Designing, and Git
- A **projects section** with details of my portfolio project
- Use of forms, semantic tags, and media elements

This project helped me apply everything I learned and build a complete static webpage.
